## Overview:
Dasher is a Node.js/Express server-rendered, customizable dashboard application. Handlebars partials were used to render the front-end views. The user can login using GitHub authentication. Dasher offers the user a choice of widgets (i.e. weather, calendar, news) that they can customize and save to their preferences. Settings are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Additions will be made in React.
