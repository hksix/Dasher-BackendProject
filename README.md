Dasher is server-rendered, customizable dashboard application. The user can login using GitHub authentication. Dasher offers the user a choice of widgets (i.e. calendar, RSS feed) that they can customize, and save to their preferences. All user preferences are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Handlebars.js partials were used to render the front-end views.
